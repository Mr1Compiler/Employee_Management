This application is designed to manage employees through a straightforward interface connected to a database. It is a simple project that includes features for adding, removing, searching, and deleting employee records. Admins have exclusive access via a login system to control and view the list of all employees. The application also includes a backup file for the database located in the database section. To configure the database connection, you need to specify your connection string in the DataAccessLayer -> clsDataAccessSettings.cs file. Although the current version is kept simple, there is potential to expand and enhance its functionality further. This foundational project serves as a stepping stone toward more complex and comprehensive future projects.
